# Shiny_app: Basic EDA and Analisys on the Wu Tang Clan music group



This Shiny Apps some insights about one of the most iconic rap groups of all time: the Wu Tang Clan.
Using the `spotifyr` library by the user **charlie86** (link to his work: http://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr). This library allows to pull different features about artists, tracks, album, and so on. By automatically batching API requests, it allows you to enter an artistâ€™s name and retrieve their entire discography.

This library can also be used to pull informations about personal accounts, provided an ID and a 'secret key' from a Spotify Developer user.

## Data

Using Spotify's own sound parameters, I accessed the audio features data of the nine original founder of the Wu Tang Clan. I provided some basical EDA per artist, considering three different parameters. 

# Analysis

Considered the groups' history, the last tab represent a scatterplot of all the different track provided by this artists singularly. The scatterplot is meant to represent a correlation between the spotify parameters and the "personal touch" of every single Wu Tang Clan member.
